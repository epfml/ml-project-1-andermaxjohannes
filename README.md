The six required regression implementations can be found in implementations.py, along with all other implementations of different regression functions, data preprocessing, visualization, and general helper functions.

The code used to produce our final AICrowd submission with id #243813 is in run.ipynb, including the fixed random seed used for the prediction. The code saves the predictions in the folder Predictions.

To run the code, the data must be in the folder Data, and must be called x_test.csv, x_train.csv, and y_train.csv respectively.

In Figures some figures produced by some of our code is available.

DataCleaning.ipynb was used primarily for exploring the data a bit.

testing.ipynb was used to quickly test our implementations, for which the height_weight_genders.csv dataset from the exercises was used. It should also be placed in the Data folder for the notebook to run.
